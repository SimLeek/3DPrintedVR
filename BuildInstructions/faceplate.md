### Instructions

1. Download a mold for your facecushion

Parts 2 and 3 (hidden by default) in this document were made for a specific mold: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/61231c95500795911d81a23a/w/173d9136ee75c10b37bb8142/e/9ce84bb14b25dc9a2847c6a6

You can copy that project and modify the face mask and mold as you like.

2. 3D print the faceplush mold

3. Lay out materials

Note: the spoon and cup will be ruined, so please use something disposable.

4. Make sure a sheet of saran wrap is on each inner side of the mold

(I didn't do this, so my mold got destroyed, along with some of the foam)

5. Don mask and gloves

6. Shake the FlexFoam 6 chemcials

7. Determine the volume needed

The foam mask in the link will require 4 teaspoons. However a different mask may need more or less. You can measure how much volume will be needed in OnShape:

The foam will expand 10 times. Divide the number in OnShape by 10, and you have the absolute minimum volume of liquid from the yellow and blue containers combined. Adding a little extra may be a good idea.

8. Pour the blue flexfoam liquid in first

This one comes out more slowly, so it may be harder to add all the ingredients before stirring should be completed.

9. Pour the yellow flexfoam liquid in and stir for 15 seconds

10. Pour the mixed liquid into the mold

11. Close the mold

Here I placed a bag of iron on top of the mold so the force from the foam expanding wouldn't push the mold apart.

12. Wait

The foam will take about 3 minutes to expand fully. However, it may be a good idea to wait at least a half hour for the chemical reaction to stop.

13. Pull the mold apart and remove the saran wrap

14. Lay some fabric over the foam and cut out around the foam, leaving some room.

15. Cut out another piece of fabric with the same shape as the first.

16. Use sewing machine to combine fabric layers with foam in between.

17. 3D print the connector

In [this document](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/61231c95500795911d81a23a/w/173d9136ee75c10b37bb8142/e/9ce84bb14b25dc9a2847c6a6), parts 4 and 5 make up the connector to the rest of the headset. You can modify that as needed.

Export them to stl, slice with cura, and print.

18. Glue the connector to the face plush

Velcro works too.
